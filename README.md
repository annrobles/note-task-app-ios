# Note/Task Application


Create a native application for iPhone or iPad (or Universal) that allows the user to store and manage tasks
or notes. Your application should allow user to create tasks/notes by category that user chooses (work,
school, shopping, groceries etc.). Every task taken should store a date and time it was created and the due
date/time.
<br>
<br>
The application should have the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Note that the data should be persistent.</li>
  <li>User should be allowed to sort tasks/notes by title or by date/time that were created.</li>
  <li>User should also be allowed to search for specific task/note by their name or by keyword that
may be contained in a task/note name.</li>
  <li>User should be allowed to take a picture (or use a picture that was previously taken) and store it
as part of a task/note. Multiple pictures should be allowed to be associated with the same
task/note.</li>
  <li>User should be able to change the status of the task from “incomplete” to “complete” and remove
the tasks entirely.</li>
  <li>User location that is the information on where the note was taken should be captured as part of
the note. User later should be able to see the location on a map for every note that was taken.
You don’t need to take user location for the tasks.</li>
  <li>User should be allowed to record audio and attach it to the task/note and/or use a pre-recorded
sound on the device.</li>
  <li>User can create/edit/delete categories for tasks. The purpose of these categories is to organize
tasks. A single task (parent) can contain smaller tasks (sub-tasks or children). Parent task cannot
be “complete” if not all the child-tasks are “complete”.</li>
  <li>User should be able as well to change the subject/category of a task/note i.e., move it from one
subject/category to another</li>
  </ul>
